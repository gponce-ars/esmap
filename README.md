# Resources for Manuscript "Using UAV and satellite-based sensing to detect eroded ecological states at the landscape scale"

This repository contains the scripts and datasets used in our manuscript, as well as additional resources related to our study. We use Google Earth Engine for remote sensing and drone data analyses and custom scripts to generate plots in R for some of the analysis.

## Google Earth Engine Scripts

The `GEE_SCRIPTS/` directory contains all scripts that were used to extract data from Google Earth Engine for our study. Each script is named according to the type of data it extracts and is documented with comments.

## R-Scripts

The `R_scripts/` directory includes all R scripts used for creating plots. Each script is named after the plot it generates.

## Geospatial Datasets

This repository also includes the remote sensing datasets we used in our study. These datasets are stored in the `datasets/` directory and are categorized by the source of the data.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to improve the scripts or add new data, please submit a pull request.
