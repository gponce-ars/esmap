This repository contains the scripts and datasets employed in our manuscript, in addition to further resources related to our study. We use Google Earth Engine for remote sensing and drone data analyses, complemented by custom R-scripts to generate visualizations of data along with some tables with metrics. 

Due to licensing restrictions pertaining to Planet data (i.e., PlanetScope), we are unable to provide direct access to the raw data used in this research. Should you require further information or wish to inquire about this specific dataset, or if you encounter any issues with the Google Earth Engine scripts, please contact the corresponding author directly.

## Google Earth Engine Scripts

The `GEE_SCRIPTS/`  houses the list of scripts employed for data extraction from Google Earth Engine (GEE) during the course of our research. The nomenclature of each script reflects the specific type of data it is designed to retrieve, thereby aiding easy identification and usage. Further, every script is equipped with detailed comment annotations to facilitate an understanding of its function and application.

## R-Scripts

The `R_SCRIPTS/` directory serves as the repository for the R scripts that were utilized to generate the figures and tables included in the manuscript. The datasets necessary for creating these visual and tabular elements were originally produced using GEE."

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to improve the scripts or add new data, please submit a pull request.
